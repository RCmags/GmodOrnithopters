# Garry's Mod | Ornithopters

This repository stores duplications of different in-game ornithopter designs. It includes working vehicles along with prototypes for different concepts and components. 

__Note:__ The drag tool is required as the wings have the default drag dissabled. An [E2 is used to simulate both lift and drag](https://github.com/RCmags/fin-development).
